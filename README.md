This is my repository for the PM566 midterm project. The data is quite large, so I did not include it in this repository; however, I have the code to query, download, and load the clinical data. Note that the while data will have to be queried and loaded every time a new R session is started, the download command only needs to be run once. I commented out the download function because it does take quite a while, but if the data isn't already on your machine, please uncomment to download data.
